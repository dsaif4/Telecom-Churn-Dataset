# Telecom-Churn-Dataset
The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription, will be used to develop predictive models.

## Below are some findings and recommendation
The share of loyal clients in the sample is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a "loyal customer" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (accuracy) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and will hopefully be significantly higher;
With the help of a simple forecast that can be expressed by the following formula: "International plan = True & Customer Service calls > 3 => Churn = 1, else Churn = 0", we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules automatically based only on the input data;
We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they'll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous effort, we increase the share of correct answers by 0.5% per se, then possibly we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple model with two conditions;
Before training complex models, it is recommended to manipulate the data a bit, make some plots, and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions and then experiment with more complex ones.
